<p>Welcome to the homepage for the first MICCAI “DALI” Workshop. This workshop is the result of the merger of three workshop proposals that were submitted to the <a href="https://www.miccai2021.org/en/">2021 MICCAI Conference</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hvnguyen.com/lesslabelsimperfectdataml2020">MIL3D</a> – <strong>Medical Image Learning with Less Labels</strong> – <em>(proposed 2nd edition)</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.miccailabels.org/">LABELS</a> – <strong>Large-scale Annotation of Biomedical Data and Expert Label Synthesis</strong> – <em>(proposed 6th edition)</em></li>
  <li>DAIMIA – <strong>Data Augmentation and Imputation in Medical Image Analysis</strong> – <em>(proposed 1st edition)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The MICCAI Satellite Event chairs recognized the overlap in our proposals and asked us to join forces, and DALI is the result!</p>
