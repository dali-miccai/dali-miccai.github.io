Welcome to the homepage for the first MICCAI "DALI" Workshop. This workshop is the result of the merger of three workshop proposals that were submitted to the [2021 MICCAI Conference](https://www.miccai2021.org/en/)

- [MIL3D](https://www.hvnguyen.com/lesslabelsimperfectdataml2020) -- **Medical Image Learning with Less Labels** -- *(proposed 2nd edition)*
- [LABELS](https://www.miccailabels.org/) -- **Large-scale Annotation of Biomedical Data and Expert Label Synthesis** -- *(proposed 6th edition)*
- DAIMIA -- **Data Augmentation and Imputation in Medical Image Analysis** -- *(proposed 1st edition)*

The MICCAI Satellite Event chairs recognized the overlap in our proposals and asked us to join forces, and DALI is the result!
