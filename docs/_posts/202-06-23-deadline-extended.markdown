By popular demand, the paper submission deadline has been extended to **July 2nd**! Please submit your papers on [our Microsoft CMT site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2021).

For your convenience, here are answers to some common questions we have recieved:

- Are submissions single or double blind?
  - Submissions are **double blind**. Please take measures to anonymize your submissions, just as you do for the main conference.
- Are we allowed to post our submissions as preprints?
  - Yes! We encourage this.
- Does the 8-page limit include references?
  - Yes. Please note that this is different from the 2021 main conference guidelines. You may, however, include content as supplementary material if it does not fit within this limit.
