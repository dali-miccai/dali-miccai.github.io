After receiving several inquiries from authors, we have decided to extend the paper submission deadline to **July 2nd**! Please submit your papers on [our Microsoft CMT site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2022).

We have also enabled the submission of supplementary materials. Please submit content that cannot fit within the main paper as separate supplementary materials. Note that materials must **NOT** bear any identification markers, and reviewers are under no obligation to review them. Please make sure the paper itself contains all necessary information and illustrations.
