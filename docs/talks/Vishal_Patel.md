### Abstract

Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of accurate and efficient models for medical image segmentation. However, learning highly accurate models relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Due to this, model performance drops drastically when evaluated on label-scarce datasets having visually distinct images.  Domain adaptation tries to mitigate this degradation.  In this talk, I will present some of our recent works on domain adaptive medical image segmentation.  In particular, source-free and fully test-time adaptive segmentation methods will be presented.
