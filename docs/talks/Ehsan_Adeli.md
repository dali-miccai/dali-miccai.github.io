### Abstract

In this talk, I will focus on two techniques we recently developed to deal with data scarcity and imperfections. First, I will discuss how we can learn good representations from MRIs using the self-supervised signal obtained by exploiting the repeated measures in longitudinal studies. Second, I will present our series of works for correcting data/feature distribution with respect to extraneous or confounding metadata variables. I will explain how the operation could be used to harmonize the data from multiple sites with different characteristics to build a unified learning framework.
