<p>We live in the age of algorithms.  Artificial intelligence and medical imaging communities increasingly use machine learning techniques to interpret large health-related image data.  In theory, machine learning should reduce the burden on radiologists and pathologists and would be more cost-effective and provide more consistent image interpretation than humans.  But in real world clinical care, medical images alone may not be sufficient in making accurate diagnoses and optimized treatment strategies, while the mathematical models being used today are unregulated and sometimes even uncontestable.   In this talk, I will share the construction and augmentation of multimodal data for two of our artificial intelligence apps for breast cancer screening and acute ischemic stroke detection, both clinical procedures incurring high risk of misdiagnosis.   Medical care is disease driven.  Big data is only as good as the people wielding it.  Understanding the context of disease conditions and shortfall of existing clinical procedures will help to define input data and constraints in constructing machine learning models to improve clinical care.</p>
