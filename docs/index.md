# DALI: The 3rd MICCAI Workshop on Data Augmentation, Labeling, and Imperfections

The rapid expansion of data-intensive methods for supervised learning has led to an unprecedented demand for large quantities of annotated data. However, obtaining extensive collections of medical images is exceptionally challenging, as it necessitates rare and costly expertise for annotation. Furthermore, medical data are often noisy and imperfect due to missing entries and sensing heterogeneity. A forum for discussing contemporary and practical approaches for dealing with these challenges is urgently needed.

The MICCAI Workshop on **D**ata **A**ugmentation, **L**abeling, and **I**mperfections (**DALI**) aims to provide a venue for researchers to present and discuss their experiences related to these crucial topics, fostering a collaborative environment to tackle these challenges.

## Important Dates

- **[Paper Submission](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2023) Opens**: **May 9**, 2023
- **Paper Submission Deadline**:  ~~June 25~~ **July 10**, 2023
- **Notification to Authors**:  ~~July 16~~ **July 31**, 2023
- **Camera Ready Deadline**:  ~~July 30~~ **August 17**, 2023
- **Workshop Day**: **October 12**, 2023, Vancouver, Canada

## Call For Papers

Training machine learning systems in the areas of image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation often demands an immense volume of expert-annotated data to achieve high accuracy. A larger number of labeled images enhances the performance of machine learning models by promoting better generalization and reducing overfitting. This necessity is even more critical for advanced learning architectures, such as vision transformers. Consequently, the most renowned benchmark datasets for general image recognition tasks comprise tens of thousands to millions of images.

Regrettably, acquiring such vast quantities of labeled data presents significant challenges in the medical imaging domain due to the high cost of annotation by domain experts and the scarcity of high-quality anonymized data stemming from privacy concerns. Additionally, there are distinct challenges associated with collecting annotated medical datasets. For example, while difficult to procure, instances of rare pathological conditions are crucial for accurately representing the data distribution. Furthermore, variations often exist among experts who provide labels, particularly for conditions that cause confusion among human experts and require the most assistance.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together and create a discussion forum for researchers in the MICCAI community, including those:

i. interested in the rigorous study of medical data as it relates to machine learning systems,
ii. developing and promoting novel directions of research in such techniques,
iii. contributing benchmark datasets, open challenges, and tasks that enable fair comparisons among existing and new techniques, and
iv. applying such techniques to improve the performance of medical image computing systems.

The workshop will feature invited speakers presenting popular and emerging data augmentation and contemporary approaches for learning from small and noisy medical data. The workshop welcomes submissions that present new ideas, new results, new datasets, as well as discussion and evaluation of existing approaches. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Training and evaluation with noisy or uncertain labels
- Data annotation tools and practices
- Synthetic data for medical image analysis
- Data-related foundation models
- Multi-modal learning
- One-shot/few-shot learning
- Active learning
- Semi-, weakly-, self-supervised learning
- Deep learning for small, noisy and imperfect data
- Domain adaptation/generalization
- Erroneous label detection
- Data curation
- Principles and/or case studies of annotated datasets and benchmarks
- Anonymization, PHI detection
- Other related topics

Submissions to our workshop will be managed using the same platform as the main MICCAI conference, using Microsoft CMT. Workshop paper submission website is at: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2023](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2023)

The DALI workshop will employ the same reviewing standards as the main conference. DALI workshop paper submissions should be anonymized to accommodate a double-blind review. Papers should be formatted using LaTeX or MS Word templates available at [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Manuscripts should be up to 8 pages (text, figures, and tables) plus up to 2 pages of references. In submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that no paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until the decisions have been made by our workshop. Supplemental material submission is optional, which may include:

- Videos of results that cannot be included in the main paper
- Anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals
- Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential for the understanding of the paper

Contents of the supplemental material should be referred to appropriately in the paper, and reviewers are not obliged to look at it.

## Camera Ready Submission Guidelines

Please carefully address the feedback provided by the reviewers. Submit the revised materials to the [DALI CMT site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2023) as a single zip archive, named in the format `dali23_id-X.zip`, with "X" being replaced by your unique paper ID.

Your submission should include:

1. **Manuscript**: Maximum of 8.5 pages, inclusive of text, figures, and tables, with an additional allowance of up to 2 pages for references. The file should be named `manuscript.pdf`.
2. **Supplementary Material** (Optional): Name the file `supplementary_material.pdf`. Note that source files for supplementary materials aren't mandatory.
3. **Changes Document**: A detailed list of modifications made post-review. Name the file `changes_after_review.pdf`.
4. **Copyright Form**: Download and fill out the [copyright form](https://dali-miccai.github.io/DALI23_SNCS_ProceedingsPaper_LTP_ST_SN_Switzerland.docx). The form should be signed by the corresponding author. Digital signatures will not be accepted. Save this document as `copyright.pdf`.
5. **Source Files**: Include a folder named `src/`, which houses the source files for your manuscript (e.g., `.tex`, `.bib`, `.docx`).

To ensure your paper is presented at MICCAI DALI 2023, a minimum of one paper author **must** register to attend on the second workshop day, October 12. As a general rule, this registration should be an "in-person" registration. The camera-ready submission portal will prompt you to provide the registration number of the author who will be presenting your work.

## Proceedings and CMIG Special Issue

Accepted DALI workshop papers will be published with MICCAI 2023 Proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. A selection of the best papers will also be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their work to a Special Issue in CMIG ([Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computerized-medical-imaging-and-graphics), IF: 5.7). The pre-selection of these papers will be based on editorial chair recommendations during the review process, with final decisions made by the program chairs. Extended papers should emphasize the application of DALI-related methods to address specific medical problems. Please note that even extended papers may be subject to rejection during the peer-review process of CMIG. The submission portal is open now.
